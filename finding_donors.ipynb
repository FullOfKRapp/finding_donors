    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "MODELS THAT I CHOSE:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Ensemble Method (AdaBoost)\n",
    "    - Algorithm description: \n",
    "        - Step 1: Run a weak learner on your dataset (ie: run a decision tree with 2 leaves on the census data set)\n",
    "        - Step 2: Weight the misclassified points by that weak learner as higher importance.\n",
    "        - Step 3: Fit a weak learner to your new dataset with the adjusted weights.\n",
    "        - Step 4: Repeat.\n",
    "    - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "        - Adaptive boosting can be used as a virtual recruiter that picks resumes that move on to the next round of an interview given a dataset of resumes that were labeled as \"moves on\" and \"does not move on\".\n",
    "    - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "        - The strengths of this model are that it is able to build on top of the decision tree base and it focuses on where the previous decision tree got it wrong. It executes a series of decision trees and each time it is shifting the weights to the points that were incorrectly classified. It performs well when there is a complicated non-linear separation of the data. \n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "        - Adaptive boosting relies on several weak learners such as decision trees. Therefore it follows that you can to some extent expect similar issues (but at a much smaller occurence rate) as decsion trees. For example, Adaboost with decision tress can sometimes overfit data sets. \n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        - AdaBoost works by putting more weight on difficult to classify instances and less on those already handled well. In exploring the data, I noticed that there were a number of nonintuitive cases for people who make over 50K given their features. Therefore, I think it would be best to fit something like AdaBoost that can conform to this type of data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. Ensemble Method (Bagging) \n",
    "    - Algorithm description: \n",
    "        - Step 1: Randomly sample from our census dataset (bootstrapping) and treat each new bootstrap sample like an independent dataset (ie: randomly sample 100 people from our dataset and make this set of 100 its own dataset). \n",
    "        - Step 2: Fit a weak learner to each of these bootstrap samples (ie: fit a decision tree to your sample of 100)\n",
    "        - Step 3: “Average” their outputs (ie: take the outputs of all of your decision trees produced and 'ensemble' them together)\n",
    "    - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "        - Identifying patients who are at risk for heart disease given some paramteric data and information about tests they have passed or failed.\n",
    "    - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "        - Bagging works well when certain classifiers work well for some cases and other classifiers work well for other cases. Generally it works well when all of the weak learning models that it uses prop up the weaknesses of the other. One classifier is wrong, the two others are correct. By voting with all models, you achieve a greater accuracy.\n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "        - Bagging runs several learning classifiers in parallel, which means that one classifier does not depend on the previous one. Therefore, bagging does not work properly, when all classifiers are mistaken in the same region. If all of the weak learning models that it leans on make the same mistake, the bagging algorithm will also make that mistake. Whereas something like AdaBoost would correct for a misclassified point by weighting it higher for the next weak learner.\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        - From the exploratory analysis that I performed, I believe that decision trees and Naive Bayes may be too simplistic to fit this dataset. However, I believe ensemble methods such as Bagging can help avoid the pitfalls of the simplistic models. It can work with all of the weak learners to develop a good model that will fit all of these.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "    - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "        - Facial recognition. \n",
    "    - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "        - SVM strengths are that it is very adaptable to many different kinds of data. It can separate things in a non linear fashion which can be great for datasets with a lot of features.\n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "        - The weaknesses are that this algorithm can be computationally expensive for large training sets. Additionally, the SVM cna require a lot of tuning to get just right, so it is not really \"out of the box\" ready. It can require a lot of hyperparameter tuning to get it where you want it to be for classifying data.\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        - From my data analysis, I believe I will require an algorithm that will be able to separate things in a highly non linear fashion. Overall, while it is computationally expensive to run on 100% of this dataset, perhaps after running it, I can reduce the dataset down to focus on a few key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "MODELS THAT I DID NOT CHOOSE\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "        - Spam identifier. With a Gaussian Naive Bayes, you start by making a prediction based on what you know initially and then you update that probability as you \"learn\" more and more information about a person. For instance, say you start with an initial \"there is a 25% chance that this email is spam\". But then you learn that this email contains the word \"FREE\" in it. Now taking this in to account, you may find out that there is now a 35% chance that this email is spam given your training dataset. You will do this with all of the features in your email to give yourself the best chance at identifying if it is spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "        - The strengths of the model are:\n",
    "            - It is fast for both training and prediction. \n",
    "            - It produces a model with good explainability as to why it chose something.\n",
    "        - It generally performs well in the following situations:\n",
    "            - When the independent assumption actually matches the data.\n",
    "            - For very well separated categories (meaning model complexity may not be that important for that data set)\n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "        - It is called Naive because you are assuming that all of these features are independent. One potential drawback to using this approach during this problem is if there is an inherent dependency built in to the various features. As an example, one issue we could run in to with this particular problem is if there is a dependency between \"Amount of education\" and \"Area that you work in\". A dependency like this would make one of the fundamental assumptions of Bayes rule incorrect. Therefore, the algorithm is not ideal for when you are dealing with a dataset where the features are dependent on other features. This is one of the big reasons I chose to not go with this one.\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        - Naive Bayes would be a great baseline classification for this problem because of its ease of computation and general model simplicity. However, I chose not to go with it due to the limitations it has with dependent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decision Trees\n",
    "    - Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "        - Recommending apps to people given characteristics about the person. A decision tree is like playing the game 21 questions. In this example, the algorithm will start by identifying which feature of this data set reduces the entropy (increases the knowledge/ organization/certainty) of the data most. It will then start new branches for each of the options around that feature. It will keep doing this for features until it reaches the full segmentation of the data or the limits of various hyperparameters that I can set.\n",
    "    - What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "        - This model can fit complex data sets well. Unlike something that maybe needs to be described by a mathematical function, a decision tree may be disjoint and have a lot of different cuts of the data that cannot be achieved with mathematical functions. Its adaptability, ease of running, and ease of explaining makes this a powerful approach.\n",
    "    - What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "        - The model performs poorly when it overfits the data. If you let the decision tree \"grow\" uncontrolled, you can get high variance in your model. What this means is that your algorithm is essentially memorizing your data so when you test your model with points from your testing set (that do not correspond to points in your training set), you can end up with poor accuracy. An analogy would be learning state capitals. If you learned the state capital of New York and Pennsylvania, that is not going to help you with knowing the state capital of New Jersey. The model you end up with out of a decision tree can be highly specific and non generalizeable to points outside of the training set.\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "        - The decision tree would be a good baseline to compare against, however I am going to choose to go with two ensemble methods instead as I believe the decision tree will overfit my data set.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "I am recommending that we use the AdaBoost model for the task of identifying individuals that make more than $50,000. I base this on 3 main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This algorithm scores the highest in precision. This means that of the three algorithms that we tested, when AdaBoost claimed that an individual made over $50K it was correct at a higher percentage than both the SVM and Bagging Classifier. This is reflected in the F score on the testing set when 100% of the training data is used. What this means for you is that choosing the AdaBoost algorithm will maximize the return on your investment when you choose to market to the people we classify as making more than 50K. We would really not like for you to market to someone to find out that this money was not well spent as it went toward advertising to someone who did not have a high probability of donating. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. This model is fast both in terms of prediction and training time. Of the 3 algorithms, it appears to have been the fastest to both train and predict. This will make it great for running and rerunning as you get more potential donor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This algorithm is suited well for this data because it did not overfit itself to the training data. One issue we could have run in to using other models (such as the bagging algorithm) is that you can train your algorithm to know the training data well, but not be able to extrapolate those same trends/learned knowledge to new data points that it has not seen. It appears AdaBoost has produced a more genralized solution which can better apply to the people that you come across in the future."

    "\n",
    "AdaBoost works by running our census data through several learning algorithms in a pariculate order and iterating on the mistakes the previous model makes. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, it looks at your census data set and asks questions like \"if I knew whether or not someone was married, would I be more or less confident that they made more the 50K a year?\" It does this to all of the features of your data. Once it finds the feature of the census data that knowing the answer to what this feature is makes it most confident about whether or not you make greatter then 50K, it will split the data in to two bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the algorithm assesses how accurate it was at predicting how much money someone makes. It does this by looking at all of the points that it has classified correctly and all the points that it has classified incorrectly and says \"I need to fix these misclassifed points.\" So it makes these misclassifed points count more in importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it reruns the same questioning process it went through with the new weights and repeats the process as above. It continues doing this until it has minimized its error as much as possible or it runs out of iterations to run (a parameter we set).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this process, you are left with an algorithm that can predict points given the same features as we had in our original data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it runs a prediction, it takes this model and plugs in all of the features. This will produce a prediction of whether or not someone makes 50K or more!"

    "- Marital status: This may be related to need. If you are married, perhaps you have more expenses such as a house, children, or other various items. Therefore, you are driven to go out and make more money to support all of these items. This feels like a very flimsy hypothesis, but the only thing I can really come up with haha."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
